# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `resolveJsonModule: true` in tsconfig.json to enable JSON type checking
- Initialize package.json with `npm init -y` before installing TypeScript
- Add `typecheck` script to package.json for easy TypeScript validation

Thread: OpenCode session ID
- Created config.json with demo configuration including appName, version, environment, database settings, and feature flags
- Set up TypeScript configuration with tsconfig.json to enable JSON module type checking
- Initialized package.json and installed TypeScript as dev dependency
- Added start and typecheck scripts to package.json
- Files changed: config.json, tsconfig.json, package.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript can validate JSON files when `resolveJsonModule` is enabled
  - Always run typecheck after configuration changes to ensure they pass
  - Package.json scripts should include typecheck for quality gates

Thread: OpenCode session ID
- Enhanced README.md with comprehensive installation steps including npm install
- Added detailed usage examples for development workflow and Ralph operations
- Verified typecheck passes with no errors
- Files changed: README.md, prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Always include npm install steps in README when project has dependencies
  - Usage examples should cover both development and tool-specific workflows
  - Typecheck verification is essential for acceptance criteria validation
